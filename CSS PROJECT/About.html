<h1>RESTURANT</h1>
<P>A restaurant is a place where food and beverages are prepared and served to customers. Restaurants offer a range of dining experiences, from casual to fine dining, and typically feature a menu with various categories of dishes. Here's a breakdown of common menu categories:

    1. Appetizers (Starters)
    Appetizers are small dishes served before the main meal to stimulate the appetite. They are often lighter than main courses but full of flavor. Examples include:

    Steak: Grilled cuts of beef, often served with sides like mashed potatoes and vegetables.
    Pasta Dishes: Like spaghetti Bolognese, fettuccine Alfredo, or lasagna.
