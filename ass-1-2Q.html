<p style="background-color:honeydew;color:dark green;font-size:20px;">Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence
 allowing code to run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It supports features
 like automatic memory management (garbage collection) and built-in security mechanisms.
 Java is widely used for web applications, Android development, and large-scale enterprise systems.
 Its "write once, run anywhere" principle makes it versatile across platforms.
 Java also has extensive libraries and frameworks, aiding in efficient software development.
 Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation.
 It follows a strong typing discipline, meaning variables must be explicitly declared and data types are enforced. 
 Java supports multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of code, which is essential for building responsive applications.
 It also features exception handling, making it easier to manage errors in a structured way.
 With an active community and frequent updates, Java continues to evolve, 
 introducing features like lambda expressions and streams in Java 8 and modularization in Java 9,
 ensuring it stays relevant in modern software development.</P>
